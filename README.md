### This repository comprises my solutions to various tasks requiring a variety of SQL skills. They were assigned due to Database systems university course. 

The database that was used consisted of three tables: 

**EMPLOYEES**: emp_id, surname, name, job, boss_id, hire_date, salary, add_salary, dept_id.

**DEPARTMENTS**: dept_id, dept_name, address.

**JOBS**: name, min_salary, max_salary.
